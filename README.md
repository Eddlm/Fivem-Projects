Here you got the full sourcecode of the projects I do for FiveM. One folder per project. C#. Feel free to learn from them and take bits for your own purposes.

Do credit me somewhere, if you're a developer and use any of them on your FiveM server. Mostly so people can look me up and find more stuff they may like.

## Develpment cycles
I aim to have a stable update each month, for one project of the listed.

## Issues
Feel free to open issues for me to look at and fix.

Also, my DMs are open at:
- Eddlm#7436 @ Discord 
- [GTA5mods/Eddlm](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/Eddlm)

## Feature requests
Uhhhh read below. I'm open to adjustments, improvements and options/toggles on existing features, but not whole new additions or features.

## The do$h matters
These projects are part of a racing server I am working on. However, unlike many others I won't hold to the magic all to myself, as you can see.

In trying to keep it user and server owner friendly, I am also making an effort to **include proper documentation** and allow people to **configure and enable/disable** each subsystem separately, to allow total control over the features you like. 

That's extra time I spend figuring out modularity and implemeting the toggles and rules for 'em. More time than just doing all hardcoded for my server.

So, toss a coin to your witcher! If you use my features on your server or play on a server that uses them, a bit of $$$ on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/eddlm), [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=A9wAT7grRKOAK9UZRHXFWk1gSSAVnAL0KPulmR_LgK9AincnC8aAVHWB6Hq1EuwUxzh33MWOQ-RxC_ei&locale.x=en_GB) or [Patreon]() is a nice form of 'Thank you' for my work.

Some money flowing will also speed up development, if you're waiting on some feature. I can excuse putting away other matters to work on development and **push updateS faster** if people show real interest.

Whole racing server project is planned at 3 years vista tops for now.
