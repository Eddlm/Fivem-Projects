Here you got the full sourcecode of the projects I do for FiveM. One folder per project. C#. Feel free to learn from them and take bits for your own purposes.

Plans:
- Gamemodes: Racing system, Cops 'n' Crooks, Car Football, Speed Traps, 
- Server Systems: Soft Colissions, 
- Client systems: Scripted Physics, Scripted Feedback (camerawork), Nitrous (shots & gradual), Glowing Brakes, Custom Performance (Handling edits as Tuning), advanced Engine Sound Swapper, V-Stancer re-purposed

## Resources & your server
Each folder contains the source, resource, and documentation for each project. As a server owner, do credit me somewhere, mostly so people can look me up and find more stuff they may like.

## Develpment cycles
I aim to have a stable update each month, for one project of the listed. Whichever I need.

## Issues
Feel free to open issues for me to look at, and fix.

Also, my DMs are open at:
- Eddlm#7436 @ Discord 
- [GTA5mods/Eddlm](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/Eddlm)

## Feature requests
Uhhhh read below. I'm open to adjustments, improvements and options/toggles on existing features, but not whole new additions or features.

## The do$h matters
TL;DR: Some money thrown my way helps with:
- Quicker updates
- Quicker bugfixes
- Proving me I'm doing the right thing spending time on user/dev-friendly configs, docs and publishing the sources

Long form,

These projects are part of a racing server I am working on. But I'm not keeping them private as one tends to do with personal projects. I am trying to contribute to the FiveM community with them. Specifically C# sourcecodes, which we kind of lack a bit.

Also, In trying to keep the resources user and server owner friendly, I am also making an effort to **include proper documentation** and allow people to **configure and enable/disable** each subsystem separately, to allow total control over the features you like. 

**That's extra time** I spend figuring out modularity and implemeting the toggles and rules for 'em. More time than just doing all hardcoded for my server.

So, toss a coin to your witcher! If you use my features on your server or play on a server that uses them, a bit of $$$ thrown my way is a nice form of 'Thank you' for my work.

Some money flowing will also speed up development, if you're waiting on some feature. I can excuse putting away other matters to work on development and **push updateS faster** if people show real interest.

Whole racing server project is planned at 3 years vista tops for now.
